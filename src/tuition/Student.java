 * also contains getter and setter methods for the Student's tuition, total
 * payment amount, tuition amount due, and number of credits attributes. This
 * class also contains getter methods for the Student's profile attribute,
 * in addition to a method for paying tuition. The Student class
 * also has methods to compare with other Student objects and to generate a
 * String representation of this Student's information.
